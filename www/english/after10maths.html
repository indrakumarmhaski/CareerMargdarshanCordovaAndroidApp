                <p class="description-text"> 
                    If you are going to choose mathematics in your 11th class 
                    as your main subject then we would like to introduce you with your 
                    other subjects which you will have to study too. The two other main 
                    subject which you will be studying along with maths are physics and chemistry,
                    if you think these subjects are difficult to learn then don't worry they are not 
                    as difficult as you think, maths offers you vast career options after your 12th. <br>

                    There are many career options which you can choose with mathematics. The following
                     organisation/deparments are open for students to have a great career in mathematics.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Opportunities in government organisations</strong>
                    <li>ISRO (The Indian Space Research Organisation)</li>
                    <li>DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation)</li>
                    <li>NAL (National Aeronautics Limited)</li>

                    These organisations need mathematicians to solve sophisticated mathematical
                     problems releated to their respective research areas of space, defence and 
                     aeronautics.

                     <br>
                     <strong>Opportunities in Private Industries</strong>
                     <li>IT companies are another good option, where they need mathematicians to work 
                         in their research department. With every little thing having a computerised chip
                          inside, the complexities involved in calculations and design of these things need
                           expert mathematicians at its core.
                     </li>
                     <li>Banks and Insurance companies needs mathematicians who combines maths and 
                         stats to come up with various financial models / products (eg., loans, 
                         investments etc.,). Only a skilled mathematician is able to calculate and 
                         reason to design such complex and critical financial models.
                     </li>
                     <li>Biotechnology companies needs students with strong academic background in
                          biology and mathematics for their research
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <strong>After 12th Courses in Mathematics</strong>
