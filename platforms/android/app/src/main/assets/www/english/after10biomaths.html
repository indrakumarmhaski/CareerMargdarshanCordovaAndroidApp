                        Mathematics + Biology 
                </h3>

                <p class="description-text"> 
                    The benefits of taking both Maths and Biology in high school 
                    CBSE is that you can switch between fields with ease when you 
                    are finished with your Boards and are applying to colleges. <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Take these two things into consideration:</strong><br>
                    1. If you want to go for Engineering streams in college, you need 
                    to have a Maths. <br>
                    2. To enter Medicine/Life Sciences, Biology is a pre-requisite, 
                    everywhere, but some places ask for Maths too.
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong>We must warn you, taking BOTH can be taxing, both for:</strong> <br>
                    1. Biology students - considering the unsaid reason many people opt for Biology 
                    - they don't get/need higher-level Maths as taught in Indian schools. <br>
                    2. Engineering aspirants - Biology, to them, is just another burden as a 
                    subjective course (can’t score 100) and to them, needs ‘rote-learning’ rather 
                    than calculations for them to use convoluted Vedic Maths techniques.
                    <br>  <br>
                    If you are looking for 'scope', medicine in India is stagnant, and the Life Sciences 
                    is still very backward here. Recent trends seem to suggest India will not be very 
                    forthcoming of new advances in the biotechnology sector, at least for the next few years. 
                    My advice - Opt for Biology without Maths if you are determined to stay in Biology, or if 
                    you want to go abroad. (here SAT and GRE Math is all you need)
                    <br> <br>
                    Engineering is still hot in India (especially EEE/ECE, Civil and Mechanical/Automobile),
                    so that's a 'safe bet'. You can take Biology on the side if you can understand it 
                    (or have the talent to successfully ‘mug it all up’, as many here do) and keep it 
                    as a backup option if you think you might look that way.
